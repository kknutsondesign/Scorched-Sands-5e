### World
Campaigns take place on the continent of Alra, primarily focused in and around the desert region known as the Scorched Sands. A viscous black liquid called Orrum is produced in this region, notable for its ability to hold an arcane charge. Exports of Orrum in recent years have drawn the attention of various world powers.

The world before Orrum, while not entirely unmagical, would best be described as low fantasy. A particularly skilled magician over the course of months might trap enough background energy in an arcane focus to cast a spell or two, but magic was largely relegated to an aristocratic pastime. The discovery of Orrum is sending shock waves across the civilized world, magic is on the rise, and Orrum powered machines are everywhere.

### The Scorched Sands
Once called the Sapphire of Alra the landlocked Orrid Sea dominated the interior of the continent. Alas, much as the rest of Alra was changed in the wake of the Desolation, so were the pristine waters whose bounty birthed the mighty Orrin Empire. As the burning winds burst over the tranquil waters the waves shrank away from the terrible heat. Only a vast expanse of sand remains, broken only by former islands reaching forlornly towards the sky, as if longing to be lost in a sea of blue once more.

The desert region now at the heart of Alra is known as the Scorched Sands. Inhabited by strange fauna that evolved in the chaotic energies of the Surge, this dry waste was thought uninhabitable for the better part of five hundred years. Despite this, in the last century the Orrin Remnant has founded a new empire in the sands, carving massive cities into cliff and canyon alike. Those unable to afford foods flown in from more hospitable land make do with the strange meats harvested from the desert life. Water is drawn from vast underground reservoirs, kept topped off by near daily airship deliveries.

The largest of these cities, known as Overhang, is reported to support between ten and twenty thousand people. The city is ruled by the great families of the Orrin Remnant, they surround themselves with an upper class of wealthy merchants grown fat on the Orrum Trade. Below them are various mercenary groups, airship captains, and the treasure hunting adventures that employ the aforementioned parties. At the bottom of the social ladder is the working class, employed in the great Orrum factories. Paid a subsistence wage they are little more than slaves, lured to the desert by promise of fortune they are now unable to afford passage out.

### The Desolation and the Orrin Empire
North of the Scorched Sands lies a region now known as the Deadlands, encircled on three sides by impenetrable mountain ranges, this region was once the seat of the mighty Orrin Empire. This once rich nation fell in an event known as The Desolation; their former lands now a cracked and scarred hellscape. Few dare enter the Deadlands, and fewer still return. No maps of the region have been made since the Desolation struck, and it remains unclear what, if anything, remains of the Orrin capital.

The actual cause of the Desolation remains unclear, though cynics have been known to remark that the Orrin Remnant hold the answers hostage. What is commonly known started approximately nine hundred years prior. The few remaining journals and historical texts from the era tell of the Orrin Empire putting out a grand summons to the greatest sorcerers of the age, promising riches and positions of power to all who would heed their call. Shortly thereafter all contact with Alra and the Orrin Empire went dark. Captains who dared approach the landmass were never heard from again. It was not until two hundred years had passed that the seas calmed enough for an expedition to discover the lost continents fate was deemed viable. The land they found was a charred and cracked husk of its former self.

#### Surges

While parts of Alra are recovering and slowly becoming fertile once more, powerful [[Surge]]s of raw untamed energy continue to burst forth from the heart of the Deadlands. Common belief holds that they originate from the ruin of Orrin sitting as it does in the heart of that most forsaken place. The mountains that once protected the great city from invasion now serve to channel the phenomenon, funneling the chaotic energies south across the Deadlands and over the Scorched Sands.

The [[Surge]] is as unpredictable as the energy it is comprised of, an average day is liable to see two, perhaps three surges. Though as long as a week has been recorded with no Surge, and reports of days in which it’s easier to count the breaks between them have been known.

To be caught in the path of a Surge is certain death. The raw untamed energies are well known for their chaotic nature, warping all that they touch. To be affected by them, however, one would first have to survive the howling, burning winds that precede it. The force of the Surge slams the air forward at terrifying speeds, while the violent force of it super heats the newly created torrent. This violent force is strong enough to lift a man off his feet and hurl him like a child’s toy. Unpleasant though that may be, it would atleast be short lived, as the searing heat would turn his bones to ash. Truly the wind is what kills.

The ferocity of these winds begins to diminish as it reaches the sands; still strong enough to cause sandstorms, but rarely fatal. The surge itself weakens with the wind, dissolving over the desert, if the conditions are right and the individual has keen eyes one may witness what can best be described as translucent shimmering rain. Occasionally a great Surge will push right over the desert and continue south. These rare events are cause for much alarm as the winds remain deadly much longer than normal, and reports exist of strange events occurring as the massive body of chaotic energy passes overhead.

### Orrum
Orrum is the cornerstone of this campaign setting. As a Surge dissipates over the desert this oil like substance draws in its raw arcane potential. Initially this charged oil was only of use to magicians, at last able to draw large quantities of energy to power their spells. While before it would take months to charge a focus enough for a single spell, a barrel of grade three Orrum allowed the aspiring arcanist to perform ten or even fifteen complex incantations with ease.

Unfortunately for the would-be sorcerers, low grade Orrum loses its charge rapidly. Exposure to the Surge reignites it nearly instantly, but for those unable or unwilling to live in the desert this meant exorbitant expense.
	
What started as a novelty for weekend wizards quickly became an essential commodity for governments around the world. Through a process of carefully carving arcane wards and runes on the interior of an Orrum holding container, the oil was found capable of self activation.

Though the oils energy decays naturally, the majority of magics only require a fraction of the power contained within. An Orrum lamp running on grade two oil might channel it’s light spell for three or four months before needing to be recharged.

As the possibilities presented by this new technology became clear, something of an Arcane Revolution kicked off. Simple light spells were child’s play, and it quickly progressed to mechanical parts being enchanted to move on their own. Entire Orrum powered factories were created for the production of simple goods, needing only a skeleton crew to make sure the machines remained operational.

### Uses for Orrum
The uses for Orrum are only limited by the quantity available, and the skill of those working with it. it is worth noting that the farther away from the sands a country lies the more energy is lost during transportation, even as the cost rises. It’s not a stretch to say that the power of nations has been shifted in the last hundred years purely by their proximity to the Scorched Sands. Conversely within the Sands themselves the fairly reliable daily Surges keep Orrum well charged, allowing impressive feats of magic to be attempted even with the lowest grade oils.

#### Orranists
Orranist is a recent term given to those who use Orrum powered magics without any actual knowledge of spellcasting. These individuals frequently carry special vials of Orrum, designed such that one portion of the vial holds the Orrum, while another is carved with runes. When manipulated correctly the Orrum flows over the runes causing them to activate and their effect to manifest.

Orranists are often considered to be risk takers as their spells don’t always work as they may hope. A poorly etched vial may, for example, turn what was meant to be a full body shielding spell into an airtight tomb. Risks aside it’s not uncommon for a wealthy individual to carry a loaded fireball vial with them for self protection.

Some Orranist also take an interest in tinkering with mechanical contraptions. Manuals of conventional runes for hobbyists are common enough, and many Orranists create small devices to aid them.

#### Airships
Airships are a recent innovation, first created by the Orrin Remnant as a means of rapidly shipping Orrum before it becomes inert. The actual mechanics behind levitating such a large object are complex, involving many etched pipes lining the interior of the vessel.

The amount of Orrum required to keep one of these ships airborne varies with both the weight and the method of propulsion, as well as the quality of the etchings the Orrum running over them. A light wooden ship using sails with high grade oil and finely etched pipes might stay airborne for two or three weeks on a full charge before needing to return to the desert. Conversely a large metal based craft running on Orrum powered turbines may last as little as a day or two before needing to be recharged.

As the demand for Orrum rose, and the incredible potential it had sunk in, various nations began investing in militarized airships. Reports of hulking iron behemoths crawling across the sky are becoming more common. The cost of fresh Orrum to power such crafts may be astronomical, but the power they convey in military engagements is equality astounding.

The Orrin Remnant itself commands a terrifying fleet of ships. Designed to counter smugglers and sky pirates, they favor light fast wooden vessels. Rather than waste Orrum on large armored craft they rely on speed and magic. Similar in concept to the Orranists vials, their ships are equipped with arcane cannons. By redirecting Orrum to them they are capable of firing a wide variety of spells, or even projecting shielding auras. The knowledge of arcane lore required to operate an O.R. ship at it’s full potential is immense.
