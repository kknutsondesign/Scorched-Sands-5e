### Campaign Overview


#### The First Spellscrawl Riot
This adventure covers the happenings of the first spellscrawl riot. As weekend wizardry rises, more and more average people carry the power of the arcane in their pockets. With the rise of adventure also comes the the influx of people drawn in by the promise of riches meeting the reality of a world where easy riches are easily lost. Expecting the boom of a magical goldrush they find most plateaus are company towns controlled with an iron fist by the real Powers of the sands. After spending a fortune to be ferried across the sea many are left stranded without the capital or means to make their way home again.


#### Powers Of The Sands
This section describes some of the vested interests that have recolonized the sands of Alra. Each and all have some goal that drives them to make deals, push against each other, and ultimately come in conflict open or otherwise with other denizens of Alra.

##### The Orrin Remnant
The old princes, cousins, and pretenders that claim some connection to the Old Orrin Kingdom. These were the first to find Alra again and bring the news back to the world. They are an insular group that love showing off with the money and clout the Orrum trade has gifted.

The Orrin Remnant, or O.R. as stenciled on so many of their vessels, 


#### People of the desert
This section describes the groups that have formed out of the boat loads of people ferried in to the remnants of the Old Orrin Empire. These groups aren't exclusively aligned with any Power and people usually have connections to a handful of groups at any given time. People can be Factory Workers that dabble as Weekend Wizards and have family that are Rock Hoppers who help out.
