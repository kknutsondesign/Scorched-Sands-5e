As a DM you act as the eyes and ears of your players so preparing ahead of time for what people in the world have on the forefront of their minds as they experience new people and places helps to create a more complete and feature rich imagination-scape

For SS in particular there are a few things that will be immediately apparent to every creature as they travel:

- The sand
- The heat
- and The wind

This is ontop of all the normal concerns of human existence.


Some other special concerns would be how or if players have special ways of perceiving the environment:
- darkvision
- magic senses
- a pets responses



A good rule of thumb is 3 sentences of introduction. Then open it up to players asking more about the situation and specifics.



##### Locations

Some tools for describing things is know how people like to orient. 


Be consistent and don't be afraid of asking for clarification and rolling with what the players remember.

Don't waste your players time, let them know some actionable things and build their confidence that if they want to go do something you can accommodate them

It doesn't have to be a 'the player is always right' scenario, but if you need them to do something to move the plot along be always thinking about how what they want to do ties back into that
